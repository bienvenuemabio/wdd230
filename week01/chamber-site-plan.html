        <!-- ------------------------Steps 6-9------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Color Palette</h3>
        <!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in Canvas then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

        <!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below. Replace the href value that is there with yours. Make sure to paste it into both the href value and the content text of the <a> tag -->
        <p>Palette URL:</p>
        <a href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
            target="_blank">https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c</a>

        <table class="colors">
            <tr>
                <th>Primary</th>
                <th>Secondary</th>
                <th>Accent 1</th>
                <th>Accent 2</th>
            </tr>
            <!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
            <tr>
                <td class="primary">[#396E94]</td>
                <td class="secondary">[#E7C24F]</td>
                <td class="accent1">[#A43312]</td>

            </tr>
        </table>

        <!-- ------------------------Steps 10-12------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Typography</h3>
        <!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

        <h4>
            Heading Font: [green]
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <h4>
            Paragraph Font: [black]
            <!-- change this -->
        </h4>
        <h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
        <p>
            Scenarios are questions that are asked by a site visitor who represents the target audience of the
            organization or company. The questions will drive the content of the website as it provides answers to the
            questions. Again, much of the content specifications will actually be provided but start thinking about the
            target audience of a chamber of commerce site. Visit real chamber of commerce sites. Include at least three
            scenarios.
        </p>
        <h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>
        <p class="colored">
            The Chamber of Commerce Project is a website project that will be built throughout the course. The goal of
            the project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through development specifications that match
            learning activities and assignments. You will select the town, city, municipality, or region, such as your
            home town, to be the location subject of the site. The project provides opportunities to apply the concepts
            by planning, designing, developing, and maintaining a website. </p>

        <!-- ------------------------Step 13------------------------------ -->

        <h3>Navigation</h3>
        <!-- Think about how you want your navigation bar to look. In the site-plan.css file change the colors to your colors to get the look you desire. -->

            <a href="#">Home</a>
            <a href="#">discovery</a>
            <a href="#">Directory</a>
